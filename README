This plugin aims at generating tags for a whole project. 
Exuberant Ctags is required for this plugin:
http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
This plugin is quite useful when used with omnicomplete plugins, such as: 
OmniCppComplete: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520
pythoncomplete: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1542
vim must be compiled with python support for this plugin to run. At least python 2.4 is required. Python 3.x is not supported currently.

For C/C++ projects, there's no need to generate a seperate tag file for the
included header files any more! This plugin will also parses the header files
cited in your source code, so a tag file providing information of all sources
files in your project and header files included in your sources would be
generated. 


The following is a short tutorial.

First, enter your project root directory, for example /home/user/myproject.
Then create a project file, the file name must be "project.prom". Edit this
file. Copy the following content to this file:
=========
[general]
sources=source1,source2,...
include_dirs=include_dir1,include_dir2,...
tagprog=ctags_command
tagflag=--your-tag-flags
=========

Replace source1,source2,... with your source file, such as main.c,
src/foo.cpp;

replace include_dir1,include_dir2,... with your include directories, such as
/usr/include, /usr/local/include (not required for non C/C++ project, in fact,
even for C/C++ project, it is also optional);

replace ctags_command with your ctags command, such as ctags, /usr/bin/ctags;

replace --your-tag-flags with your tag flags, such as --extra=+q.


For example, for the following source tree:

- src/
  main.c
  foo.c
  bar.c
- include/
  foo.h
  bar.h

The project file could be like the following:
=========
[general]
sources=src/main.c,src/foo.c,src/bar.c
include_dirs=./include,/usr/include
tagprog=ctags
tagflag=--extra=+q
=========

Then save the file.

Use vim to open a source file, such as source1.cpp. Use the command
":GenProTags" to generate the tag file(this might be some kind of slow). if
you don't want to be blocked when generating the tag file, use ":GenProTagsBg"
instead. This will generate the tag file in background.
